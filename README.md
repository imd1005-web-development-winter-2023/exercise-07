# Exercise 07 - CSS

Welcome to exercise 07 - let's modify some font styles.

## Steps

1. Create a new folder on your local machine and open it up in VSCode or use an existing folder to work in
2. Create an HTML page in your local working folder (you can call `index.html` or any name you want)
3. Copy the contents of the `index.html` file in this repository into your newly created HTML file
4. Create a CSS file in your local working folder and call it `style.css`
5. Copy the contents of the `style.css` file in this repository into the local CSS file you created
6. Apply the following style adjustments to the h1 on the page:
7. Make the text bold
8. Align the text to center
9. Make all of the text uppercase using just CSS
10. Set the font size to `3rem`
11. Set the letter space to `30px`
12. If you get stuck, have a look inside the `\solution` folder for one way of putting this together
